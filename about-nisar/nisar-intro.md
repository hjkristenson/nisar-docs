# Introduction

## The NISAR Mission

NISAR is a joint Earth-observing mission between [National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)](https://www.nasa.gov/) and the [Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)](https://www.isro.gov.in/), with the goal to make global measurements of the causes and consequences of land surface changes using advanced radar imaging. 

The mission concept and the resulting partnership were in response to the [National Academy of Science's 2007 survey](@decadalSurvey2007) of Earth observational priorities for the next decade, known as the decadal survey. 

One of the top priorities identified in this survey was to gain data and insight in three Earth science domains:
* Ecosystems
* Deformation of Earth's Crust 
* Cryospheric Sciences

Refer to NASA's [NISAR Mission](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/nisar/) website for more information.

## NISAR Science Objectives

The [NISAR Mission Science Users' Handbook (2025)](@nisarMissionHandbook2025) defines the key scientific objectives as follows:

*NISAR addresses the needs of Solid Earth, Ecosystems, Cryospheric, and Soil Moisture science disciplines, with a specific focus on the following key scientific objectives to:*

1. *Determine the likelihood of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and land subsidence*  
2. *Understand the dynamics of carbon storage and uptake in wooded, agricultural, wetland, and permafrost systems*  
3. *Understand the response of ice sheets to variations in the climate, the interaction of sea ice and climate, and impacts on sea level rise worldwide*
4. *Constrain global patterns of soil moisture and their temporal variability, across a wide range of land cover types and climate regimes*

## Role of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is located on the outskirts of Pasadena, California. Founded in 1936 by California Institute of Technology (Caltech) researchers, JPL is a research and development lab federally funded by NASA and managed by Caltech.

[JPL leads the U.S. portion of the NISAR project on behalf of NASA](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/press-kits/nisar/mission-overview/spacecraft/), including project management, providing [physical components of the satellite](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/nisar/about-the-satellite/), testing, coordinating science product development, and developing and processing data products. 

JPL generates a suite of products from NISAR mission data, ranging from Level 0 to Level 3, which ASF makes avaialble to the public. Refer to the [data products](../data-products) section for more information on the NISAR data products available. 

## Role of the Alaska Satellite Facility

The [Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF)](https://asf.alaska.edu/) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) has been selected to archive the data from the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission. ASF maintains the NASA archive of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from various satellites and aircraft, providing these data and associated services to the public in support of NASA’s Earth Science Data and Information System ([ESDIS](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/about/esdis-project?_ga=2.174193322.963840534.1558367114-1499519562.1541105389)) project.

ASF will utilize NASA's [Earthdata Cloud](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/about/earthdata-cloud-evolution) for processing, storage and distribution of the data. This environment leverages Amazon Web Service (AWS) infrastructure, allowing datasets to be accessed directly and efficiently in cloud computing workflows.
